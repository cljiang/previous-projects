# previous-projects

Here I list some of the project programming scripts I created lately.

1. duration.py --- to predict route duration using starting and ending locations. In this script, I applied linear regression, decision treee, random forest, and neural network algorithms to train the model and evaluate the model performance in the test data set.

2. models.py, views.py, urls.py, forms.py, post_detail.html --- design an online journal website using Django framworks. You can post your journal and upload your images, and your family and friends can comment on your journal. The best part is that you can save all these (journal,comment,images) to a pdf file and present it to your friends, print it out, or saved as a journal book for memories.

3. get_rooms.py, analyze_rooms.py, and plot_rooms.py --- scrape Airbnb listing from website, clean up data, explore data, and apply linear regression and random forest to gain business insights.

4. case_study_LinearRegression_NeuralNetwork.pdf --- two examples of the machine learning methods I implemented recently.
